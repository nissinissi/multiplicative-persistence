# multiplicative-persistence

The multiplicative persistence of an integer is the how many times you can replace the number by the product of its digits, before it becomes a single digit.

It is conjectured that the largest possible persistence for an integer in base 10 is 11 (minimally achieved by 277777788888899).

This repository includes an attempt to find other integers whose multiplicative persistence is 11, using a brute force search and some of the observations in link (1).
